## Previous Knowlegde

To follow the course some prerequisites are required. 


### Math calculus

* Matrix Algebra 

Most algorithms in deep learning are based on matrix algebra and GPUs are especially fast in performing matrix operations.Therefore basic knowledge of matrix algebra is needed to understand deep learning algorithms.  A good overview can be found at [http://www.souravsengupta.com/cds2016/lectures/Savov_Notes.pdf](http://www.souravsengupta.com/cds2016/lectures/Savov_Notes.pdf) you will only need the first two pages - stuff like Eigenvalues and basis expansion are note strictly required for the course.

* Calculus

You should know the chain rules, since it is the core of the back propagation algorithm.For a refresher check out e.g. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule) or for an alternative approach the following [link](https://betterexplained.com/articles/derivatives-product-power-chain/)

* Statistics

You should now the basic descriptive statistics (mean, standart deviation, median, z-transformation) and have a solid understanding of probability and know thing like $P(A)$, $P(A,B) = P(A|B) P(B)$. You might consider the following [cheat sheet](http://web.mit.edu/~csvoss/Public/usabo/stats_handout.pdf) (tests are not required). 

### Computer stuff

* Python

You need a basic knowledge of python, see e.g. [datacamp python cheat sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/PythonForDataScience.pdf). We will use jupyter notebooks and make use of numpy, matlibplot and of course the deep learning libraries TensorFlow, and Keras.
