## Previous Knowlegde

To follow the course some prerequisites are required. 


### Math calculus

* Matrix Algebra 
To be run on the GPU, the algorithms are all formulated in terms of matrix algebra. Therefore basic knowledge of matrix algebra is needed, stuff like Eigenvalues and basis expansion are note strictly required for the course. A good overview can be found at [http://www.souravsengupta.com/cds2016/lectures/Savov_Notes.pdf](http://www.souravsengupta.com/cds2016/lectures/Savov_Notes.pdf) you will only need the first two pages.

* Calculus
You should know the chain rules, since it is the core of the back propagation algorithm.

* Statistics
You should now the basic descriptive statistics (mean, standart deviation, median, z-transformation) and have a solid understanding of probability and know thing like $P(A)$, $P(A,B) = P(A|B) P(B)$. You might consider the following [cheat sheet](http://web.mit.edu/~csvoss/Public/usabo/stats_handout.pdf) (tests are not required). 

### Computer stuff

* Python
You need a basic knowledge of python, see e.g. [datacamp python cheat sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/PythonForDataScience.pdf). We will use jupyter notebooks and make use of numpy, matlibplot and of course the deep learning libraries TensorFlow, and Keras.
