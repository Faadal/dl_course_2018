# Deep Learning (CAS machine intelligence) 

This course in deep learning focuses on practical aspects of deep learning. 

For the hands-on part you could install anaconda ([details and installation instruction](anaconda.md)) or use the provided a docker container ([details and installation instruction](docker.md)).

To easily follow the course please make sure that you are familiar with the some [basic math and python skills](prerequistites.md). 

## Other resources
We took inspiration (and sometimes slides / figures) from the following resources.

* Deep Learning Book (DL-Book) [http://www.deeplearningbook.org/](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/). This is a quite comprehensive book which goes far beyond the scope of this course.

* Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition [http://cs231n.stanford.edu/](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/), has additional material and [youtube videos of the lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC). While the focus is on computer vision, it also treats other topics such as optimization, backpropagation and RNNs. Lecture notes can be found at [http://cs231n.github.io/](http://cs231n.github.io/).

* More TensorFlow examples can be found at [dl_tutorial](https://github.com/oduerr/dl_tutorial/tree/master/tensorflow/) 

* Another applied course in DL: [TensorFlow and Deep Learning without a PhD](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/01/learn-tensorflow-and-deep-learning-without-a-phd)
